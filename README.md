# Visual-Based-Localization-Papers

Contributed by Dehao Zhang.

The relocalization task aims to estimate the 6-DoF pose of a novel (unseen) frame in the coordinate system given by the prior model of the world.  The most related topics are SLAM and SfM.

<summary> <b>[Wide area localization on mobile phones]</b> Clemens Arth. ISMAR, 2009.</summary> 
The first step is reconstruction and save the result by PVS(potentially visible sets). Then feature matching and pose etismation... In a normal relocalization way.

This work combines the local tracking and global relocalization so they throwed the loop closuring in the tracking. The main contributions of this paper are the three align methods: alignment only once, alignment using the global keyframe positions and alignmnet Using the global 2D-3D matches.

This paper thought there were lots of fake "state of the art", so it gave a modular pipeline which incorporate dozens of methods for feature extraction, matching, and pose estimation. It's worth to read!!!

<summary> <b>[Improving image-based localization by active correspondence search]</b> ECCV, 2012. </summary>
A more efficient version of the "Fast image-based localization using direct 2D to 3D machting". With 2D to 3D match onece and then do 3D to 2D.
Beacause using 2D points for find 3D points is not efficient, but using 3D points to find 2D points is efficient for the less number of 2D points.

IMU and camera fusion is performed in a tightly coupled manner by an error-state extended Kalman filter (EKF). GPS is also fused by a optimization framework.

<details>
<summary> <b>[Intermittent GPS-aided VIO: Online Initialization and Calibration]</b> Woosik Lee. ICRA, 2020. </summary>
The constraint is MSCKF-based estimator to fuse inertial, camera and asynchronous GPS measurements and this paper tried to solve the time offset problem. The method is tightly-coupled so it is not very suitable for map-based relocalization.
